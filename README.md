# CONTRIBUTE

If you have an idea for an extra feature, either ask me to implement it or
you can implement it yourself and submit a patch.  I'll do a better job in the
future of cleaning up the code and possibly making it API-like.

# TROUBLESHOOTING

- It conflicts with other Bugzilla Jetpacks and Userscripts, including the
  Bugzilla Tweaks Jetpack running.
- Developing on it has only been tested on OSX; it probably won't work anywhere
  else.

## IF THERE IS A CONFLICT WITH ANOTHER SCRIPT

  Simply disabling the feature in the Bugzilla Preferences should fix it.
